            <p>TODO: This pulls up the closest Hospitals near the user, and requests a form of what type of emergency does this person have. Once submitting the form, it will immediately notify the admins and doctors of their specialisation for them to react immediately. </p>
            <p>Or, it will just show the hospitals near the user and show their most active telephone or cellphone number.</p>
